  <!-- See below for how footnotes are incorporated.

  It's an anchor link that wraps a superscript (<sup></sup>) tag. Your first footnote link will have an href of "#f1" and you'll continue adding footnotes in that sequence ("#f2", "#f3", "etc"). Make sure to add the classes "footnote-asterisk" and "link".

  You'll add the number of the footnote in the body of your superscript tag ("<sup>1</sup>", "<sup>2</sup>", etc.")

  Check out the footnotes section to see how to handle the body of your footnote.

    These are how footnotes are incorporated. First, each one is wrapped in a "div." The "id" matches the "href" value used when you set the footnote in the "narrative" section. Unlike before, it doesn't involve a "#" sign.

    Make sure that you use match the number between the "sup" tag with what you used in the "narrative" section
