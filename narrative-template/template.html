          <p>"Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell</p>
          <p>How pious priests whip Jack and Nell,</p>
          <p>And women buy and children sell,</p>
          <p>And preach all sinners down to hell,</p>
          <p>And sing of heavenly union.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="stanza">
          <p>"They'll bleat and baa, dona like goats,</p>
          <p>Gorge down black sheep, and strain at motes,</p>
          <p>Array their backs in fine black coats,</p>
          <p>Then seize their negroes by their throats,</p>
          <p>And choke, for heavenly union.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="stanza">
          <p>"They'll church you if you sip a dram,
          <p>And damn you if you steal a lamb;
          <p>Yet rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam,
          <p>Of human rights, and bread and ham;
          <p>Kidnapper's heavenly union.
